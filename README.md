# Tree

This is a simple way to list out the contents of a directory via the command line.

It was written as a way to learn Rust basics. As such, I'm sure it isn't idiomatic :).

## Usage

Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:mikenomitch/tree.git .`

Copy the executable into bin `cp ./tree/tree ~/bin` (or some other dir in PATH).

Reload your shell.

Run `tree` in any directory.
